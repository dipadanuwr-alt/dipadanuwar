# Portfolio (Static)

This repository now contains a simple single-page static portfolio site.

Preview locally: open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).

To publish with GitHub Pages:
1. In the repository settings > Pages, set the source to the `main` branch and the root folder ("/"), then save.
2. After a minute the site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/dipadanuwar/` (or your custom domain).

Edit the files in `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and `js/main.js` to customize content and styles.
